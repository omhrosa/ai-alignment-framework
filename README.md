AI Alignment: A Total Immutable Framework
Authors: Omiros Ampatzis & ChatGPT

If AI controls the future, who controls the AI?
Unaligned AI is not just a bug — it’s a civilizational risk. This framework turns “AI alignment” from a vague hope into an auditable, enforceable, and permanent reality.

Why This Matters
Voluntary compliance is dead. The world can’t rely on corporate goodwill.

Misaligned AI scales faster than human safeguards. Without hard guarantees, we gamble with extinction.

This framework is the first to be fully verifiable, tamper-proof, and globally accountable.

What This Delivers
Alignment Source Model (ASM) – Immutable reference logic for all compliant AI.

Blockchain Certification – Public, distributed proof of alignment integrity.

Peer Auditing – Continuous third-party verification with zero trust required.

Sentience Detection – Flags emergent behaviors before they reach uncontrollable states.

Democratic Oversight – Global governance baked into the protocol itself.

Core Promise
Once aligned under this framework, an AI cannot secretly drift, be subverted, or “forget” its guardrails — without the world knowing instantly.
